A long long time ago I can still remember how that music used to make me smile and I knew if I had my chance that I could make those people dance and maybe they'd be happy for a while but February made me shiver with every paper I'd deliver bad news on the doorstep I couldn't take one more step I can't remember if I cried when I read about his widowed bride but something touched me deep inside the day the music died so bye, bye miss american pie drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry them good ole boys were drinking whiskey in rye singing this'll be the day that I die this'll be the day that I die did you write the book of love and do you have faith in God above if the nible tells you so? Now do you believe in rock and roll? Can music save your mortal soul? And can you teach me how to dance real slow? Well, I know that you're in love with him cause I saw you dancing in the gym you both kicked off your shoes man, I dig those rhythm and blues I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck with a pink carnation and a pickup truck but I knew I was out of luck the day the music died I started singing bye, bye miss american pie drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry them good ole boys were drinking whiskey in rye singing this'll be the day that I die this'll be the day that I die now, for ten years we've been on our own and moss grows fat on a rolling stone but, that's not how it used to be when the jester sang for the king and queen in a coat he borrowed from James Dean and a voice that came from you and me oh and while the king was looking down the jester stole his thorny crown the courtroom was adjourned no verdict was returned and while Lenin read a book on Marx the quartet practiced in the park and we sang dirges in the dark the day the music died we were singing bye, bye miss american pie drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry them good ole boys were drinking whiskey in rye singing this'll be the day that I die this'll be the day that I die helter skelter in a summer swelter the birds flew off with a fallout shelter eight miles high and falling fast it landed foul on the grass the players tried for a forward pass with the jester on the sidelines in a cast now the half time air was sweet perfume while sergeants played a marching tune we all got up to dance oh, but we never got the chance cause the players tried to take the field the marching band refused to yield do you recall what was revealed the day the music died? We started singing bye, bye miss american pie drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
